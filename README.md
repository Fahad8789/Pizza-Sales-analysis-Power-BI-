# Power-Bi-Project
In this project, I analyzed a pizza sales dataset to extract key business insights. The main objectives were to identify patterns in customer ordering behavior and evaluate sales performance. Specifically, I:

Determined the times of day when the highest and lowest number of orders were received.

Identified the day of the week with the most orders.

Calculated total sales over the given period.

Found out which pizza type was ordered the most frequently.

Analyzed which pizza contributed the most to overall sales revenue.
